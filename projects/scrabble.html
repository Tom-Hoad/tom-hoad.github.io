									<p>
										This was one of my first large-scale projects. This is the game of Scrabble created in JavaScript using the p5 library. The game of Scrabble involves
										2 players play against each other to build words which gain a score and when there are no letters left or no one can go with the few letters left, then
										the game ends.
									</p>
									<p>
										One of the main difficulties of this project was just creating a UI that was nice to look at and usable. Using pure JavaScript makes creating these things
										fairly difficult, and in this case, a combination of lots of arrays and 2D arrays work together to create the board as well as the hands. The board
										is actually created using 2 different arrays in parallel, with one keeping track of the type of tile (double letter, triple word, ...) and the other keeping
										track of the actual letter on that spot.
									</p>
									<p> 
										The scoring system was also a very difficult system to set up for this one due to the ability to massively crosswords across others. It ended up being a very 
										complicated combination of for loops that were used to find all the words that a player should get points for after their turn and then those were all passed into 
										a function and summed to get the total score for that turn. It is still not possible to place 1 tile as the scoring system for that has not been implemented yet, 
										however, it will be soon as it is actually a simpler system than not placing a single letter.
									</p>
									<p>
										This game gives a few options on the side as well as the ability to select letters. The toggle letters button just makes the letters invisible so you can see
										the score that the tile underneath them gives, and that can be toggled on and off. The end turn button will end a player's turn if they have played a valid word. 
										This will check for whether a word is in a valid position, however it will not actually check if the word is a real word and hence the players should do that themselves.
										The clear button removes tiles played in this turn. This can only be used if the player doesn't currently have a tile selected (in which case just place it down and then
										clear). Finally, the player can click a tile to pick it up and click a spot on the board to place it.
