										This is a recreation of the game Snake using JavaScript with the p5 library. This game has a full menu system as well as lots of options to
										change the player experience. It also saves the high score using local browser storage.
									</p>
									<p>
										The options menu in this was one of the more technical parts, since I hadn't created a multipage option screen before this point. It gives
										the ability to enable 2-player mode, as well as change things like the grid size and the number of fruits in the grid. It also has individual settings for 
										each player that let you change the controls as well as the speed and colours.
									</p>
									<p> 
										The actual gameplay was mostly done using a class for the snake and then storing everything else in a 2D array. The snake increasing in size was possibly
										the most technical part and maybe the main reason a snake class was needed, but the system worked by simply adding a timer each time a fruit was collected
										and once that timer was done, it would be at a node at the end of the snake on the fruit as the snake would have fully moved onto the next cell by that point.
										The other technical part was making the snake move in the way it does, but luckily it ended up being easy with the use of the class. The nice thing about this 
										system is, theoretically, you could have any number of snakes, which is interesting for online multiplayer, for example, but since this game is played locally it
										is limited to 2 snakes and even that is hard to have a good control scheme for.
